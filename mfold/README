#how to run mfold tests on several servers simultaneously

#on each server, copy your local bash_profile into the server
scp bash_profile flutra@node302:.bash_profile (example)

#you can check if the bash_profile was properly copied, if you run
server_address# env

#on each server, run the following git commands, where you identify your email&name
flutra@node302:~$ git config --global user.email "flutra@gmail.com"
flutra@node302:~$ git config --global user.name "Flutra"

copy the das2.txt file on your local mfold folder, which contains a list of
servers you will run the mfold tests on. Alternatively, create your own
list of servers, for the purpose of your tests (in this case, one-serv.txt)
Example:
flutra@flutra:~/swift/mfold$ cat one-serv.txt 
seeder
node302

copy the config file on your local /home/flutra/.ssh folder, and modify it
according to your needs. e.g. specify who the seeder and the rest of the
servers are. For example:
Host seeder
HostName xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

Host node302
HostName xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

on your local mfold folder, modify env.default.sh, such that all the servers
know which seeder they should connect to. For example:
export SEEDER=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Other parameters, such as the git repository, may be modified here. For example:
export ORIGIN=git://github.com/futtre/swift.git

#run the first test, build, and run
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./doall test
#start clean on all servers or kill previous swift from servers
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./doall clean
#or
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./doall rm
#build swift on the servers
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./doall build
#install netem - tweaking network simulation parameters
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./doall netem
#run swift on servers
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./doall run

run.default.sh will be run on servers, who play the role of leechers
run.seeder.sh will run on the server, defined as a seeder
NOTE: run doesn't stop by its own, so you have to stop it, using:
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./doall clean
Alternatively, check the status with ./dotop
Once the mfold test finishes, run clean script again (to stop swift on the servers)

#checking the status on servers ?
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./dotop

#parse the logs and produce index.html with graphs
flutra@flutra:~swift/mfold# SERVERS=one-serv.txt ./dohrv
